  abstract = {Accurate estimates of Pacific salmon spawners are needed to set spawning escapement goals and regulate harvests. Estimating the number of pink salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha spawning in Prince William Sound, Alaska, is difficult since annual runs have ranged between 2.2 million and 19.6 million and spawning occurs in over one thousand individual freshwater systems. Escapement monitoring is accomplished by surveying a collection of 208 index creeks several times over a period of weeks from fixed wing aircraft. Unadjusted survey counts are used to monitor escapements during the commercial fishing season, while estimates of the total number of spawners are calculated after the season using area-under-the-curve methods. We examined the accuracy of area-under-the-curve estimates by using information obtained on creeks with intertidal weirs: 3 creeks in 1990, 8 creeks in 1991, and 7 creeks in 1992. Aerial observer efficiency and stream-life values, calculated for each study creek each year of the study, used in conjunction with aerial observations, produced pink salmon escapement estimates that were on average within 10\% of weir counts for these same creeks. Currently used methods, using only the area-under-the-curve and a constant stream life of 17.5 days, produced escapement estimates that were on average less than 50\% of the corresponding weir counts. The use of a correction for aerial observer efficiency provided the greatest improvement in escapement estimates, although, the adjustment for stream life also provided substantial improvement. An investigation of the effect of survey frequency on area-under-the-curve estimates indicated that accuracy deteriorated when the survey interval exceeded 7 days.},

  abstract = {We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) to estimate missing counts of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum in Artedi, 1792)) at a weir on the Kogrukluk River, Alaska, between 1976 and 2015. The model assumed that fish passage during a breach of the weir was typical of passage during normal operations. Counts of fish passing the weir were missing for some days during the runs, or only partial counts for a given 24-hour period were available. The HBM approach provided more defensible estimates of missing data and total escapement than ad hoc or year-by-year model estimates, because estimates of passage for a given year were informed not only by counts for the current year, but also by counts for all previous years. The results of the HBM yielded less variable estimates of escapement than did ad hoc or year-by-year model estimates. The HBM represents a standardized approach to estimate missing counts and total escapement and eliminates the need for ad hoc estimates of missing counts. The model also provides managers with a measure of uncertainty around estimates of escapement and around estimates of hyper-parameters to define run curves in subsequent years with incomplete fish counts.},
